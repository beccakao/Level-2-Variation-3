		<h3>Maya Angelou</h3> </span></a>

		<ul>
		<li>A free bird leaps on the back </li><li> &nbsp Of the wind and floats downstream </li><li> &nbsp &nbsp Till the current ends and dips his wing </li><li> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the orange suns rays </li><li> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And dares to claim the sky.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		 <li>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage </li><li>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Can seldom see through his bars of rage </li><li>  &nbsp &nbsp His wings are clipped and his feet are tied </li><li>  &nbsp So he opens his throat to sing.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		 <li>&nbsp The caged bird sings with a fearful trill </li><li>  &nbsp  &nbsp Of things unknown but longed for still </li><li>  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp And his tune is heard on the distant hill for </li><li>  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp The caged bird sings of freedom.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		 <li>&nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp The free bird thinks of another breeze </li><li>  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp And the trade winds soft through </li><li>  &nbsp  &nbsp The sighing trees </li><li>  &nbsp And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright </li><li> Lawn and he names the sky his own.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li>But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams </li><li>  &nbsp His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream </li><li>  &nbsp  &nbsp His wings are clipped and his feet are tied </li><li>  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp So he opens his throat to sing.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		 <li>&nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp The caged bird sings with </li><li>  &nbsp  &nbsp A fearful trill of things unknown </li><li>  &nbsp But longed for still and his </li><li> Tune is heard on the distant hill </li>
